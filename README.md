# [Planetiler Overture Demo](https://msbarry.github.io/planetiler-overture-demo)

This demo website shows vector tiles built from the [Overture 2023-10-19-alpha.0](https://overturemaps.org/download/overture-october-2023-release-notes/) release using Planetiler's experimental [overture schema](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler/blob/overture/planetiler-core/src/main/java/com/onthegomap/planetiler/overture/Overture.java). See it here: [https://msbarry.github.io/planetiler-overture-demo](https://msbarry.github.io/planetiler-overture-demo).

Overture data has structured metadata for each element (see [schema](https://docs.overturemaps.org/themes/)), but [maplibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/) only supports simple key/value pairs. This initial tileset explodes some structs (like names) out into separate attributes, joins lists into comma-separated strings, and splits road segments to apply partial-length attributes to the full length of the output segment. More complex attributes (like [road lanes and turn/access restrictures](https://docs.overturemaps.org/reference/transportation/segment)) are just passed throughas JSON objects. These JSON objects aren't be usable for a map style, and make the tiles much larger, but let us explore what the data looks like for now.

There is ongoing discussion about how to best make use of Overture data in [Planetiler issue 636](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler/issues/636) - please comment there with any ideas or suggestions!
